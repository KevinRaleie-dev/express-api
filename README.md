# Node.js Express API

### What is an API?

The term 'api' is an acronym which stands for 'Application Programming Interface'

Modern Apis adhere to standards, typically REST, that are developer friendly, easily accessible and broadly understood.

REST suggests to create an object of the data requested by the client and send the values of the object in response to the user.
